# Investigate A Dataset
This is a project related to "DECI Y2 L3 Data Analysis & AI".

I was asked to choose from two datasets on Kaggle:
* Movies Dataset (tmdb movies 5000+)
* Soccer Dataset

And then, I was asked to investigate that dataset, and perform the whole data analysis process under the guidance of my instructors.
That was a great opportunity to apply on the concepts I've learnt in the past 3 months.
